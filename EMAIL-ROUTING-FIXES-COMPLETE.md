# 🎉 EMAIL ROUTING FIXES - COMPLETE SOLUTION

## 🚨 ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED & FIXED

### **The Problem:**
The email system was in **TEST MODE** and overriding all recipient emails:
- Manager alerts → `g.basera@yahoo.com` (test email)
- Guest confirmations → `g.basera5@gmail.com` (test email)
- Environment variables were ignored
- Category routing was bypassed

### **The Solution:**
✅ **Fixed environment variable integration**
✅ **Fixed guest email capture**
✅ **Fixed category-based routing**
✅ **Fixed email personalization**
✅ **Added test mode control**

---

## 🔧 WHAT WAS FIXED

### **1. Environment Variable Integration**
- **Before**: Edge function couldn't read environment variables
- **After**: Proper environment variable access with fallbacks
- **File**: `generate-feedback-emails/index.ts`

### **2. Guest Email Confirmation**
- **Before**: Guest email passed as `null` in some cases
- **After**: Guest email properly captured and sent
- **File**: `QuickFeedback.tsx`

### **3. Category-Based Manager Routing**
- **Before**: All manager emails went to general manager
- **After**: Food & Beverage → `basera@btinternet.com`, etc.
- **File**: `generate-feedback-emails/index.ts`

### **4. Email Recipients Override**
- **Before**: Test mode overrode all emails to test addresses
- **After**: Manager emails use environment routing even in test mode
- **File**: `send-tenant-emails/index.ts`

### **5. Email Personalization**
- **Before**: Emails said "Dear Hotel Manager"
- **After**: Emails say "Dear Sarah Johnson" (real manager names)
- **File**: `generate-feedback-emails/index.ts`

## 🧪 TESTING PROTOCOL

### **Current Test Setup:**
```bash
# Set these in Supabase Dashboard → Settings → Edge Functions
FOOD_BEVERAGE_MANAGER_EMAIL=basera@btinternet.com
FOOD_BEVERAGE_MANAGER_NAME=Sarah Johnson
HOUSEKEEPING_MANAGER_EMAIL=zara80@gmail.com
HOUSEKEEPING_MANAGER_NAME=Michael Asante
EMAIL_TEST_MODE=true  # For testing with environment routing
```

### **Test Scenario:**
1. **Submit Food & Beverage feedback** via `/eusbett/quick-feedback`
2. **Guest email**: `zaraz80@gmail.com`
3. **Expected Results**:
   - Guest confirmation → `g.basera5@gmail.com` (test mode)
   - Manager alert → `basera@btinternet.com` (environment routing)
   - Manager email says "Dear Sarah Johnson"
   - Total: 2 emails

### **Production Setup:**
```bash
# For go-live, set these in Supabase Dashboard
EMAIL_TEST_MODE=false  # 🚨 CRITICAL for production
FOOD_BEVERAGE_MANAGER_EMAIL=real.manager@eusbetthotel.com
FOOD_BEVERAGE_MANAGER_NAME=Real Manager Name
```

## 🔍 DEBUGGING

### **Check Email Logs:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM communication_logs 
WHERE feedback_id = 'your_feedback_id'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### **Check Environment Variables:**
Look for these log messages in Supabase Edge Function logs:
- `🔍 Environment variables check:`
- `📧 Manager details - Name: X, Email: Y`
- `🔧 Email routing mode: TEST/PRODUCTION`

### **Common Issues:**
1. **Still getting test emails**: Check `EMAIL_TEST_MODE` setting
2. **Wrong manager email**: Check environment variable names
3. **No guest email**: Check form submission includes guest email
4. **Generic personalization**: Check manager name environment variables

---

## ✅ SUCCESS CRITERIA

**The fix is working when:**
1. ✅ Guest receives confirmation email at provided address
2. ✅ Manager receives alert at category-specific email
3. ✅ Manager email is personalized with real name
4. ✅ Food & Beverage feedback goes to `basera@btinternet.com`
5. ✅ Total emails: 2 (guest + manager)
