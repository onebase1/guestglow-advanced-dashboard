# Response Comparison Demo

This document shows the difference between the old robotic responses and the new improved human-like responses.

## Example 1: Low Rating Review (1 Star)

### Original Review:
**Guest**: Prince B  
**Rating**: 1/5 stars  
**Platform**: TripAdvisor  
**Review**: "I only got there for them to tell me NO ROOMS. After endless efforts for them to even get me an invoice for payment. The staff seem helpless and not on top of their game. Totally confused. They asked us to wait till 12pm to see if some occupants will leave the rooms. That was surprising because they couldn't even confirm that on their system. We waited and waited as no one was telling us anything. Well, we had to quickly look for another hotel who accepted us well. Obviously Eusbett hotel is overwhelmed by the patronage it receives. Their website is poor as you can't even book from there. There will not respond to the emails. My calls were picked but three different attendants could not even do a simple booking for me, only to fly from Accra to Sunyani and you say no room. To think that they even picked us from the airport. They can do better in order to be considered a top hotel."

### OLD RESPONSE (Robotic):

Dear Prince B,

Thank you for taking the time to share your valuable feedback with us. We deeply appreciate your candid review as it helps us identify areas where we can enhance our service delivery.

I sincerely apologize for your disappointing experience regarding booking process, staff service. This does not reflect the exceptional standards we strive to maintain, and we take full responsibility for not meeting your expectations. We have immediately addressed these concerns with our team and have implemented enhanced protocols to ensure better service delivery for all our guests.

Your feedback is instrumental in our continuous improvement efforts, and we would be honored to welcome you back to demonstrate the improvements we've made. Please feel free to contact me directly at guestrelations@eusbetthotel.com for your next visit, and I will personally ensure your experience exceeds expectations.

Warm regards,

### NEW RESPONSE (Human-like):

Hello Prince,

I'm genuinely sorry about the booking confusion and room availability issues during your visit. Having to wait without clear communication after traveling from Accra must have been incredibly frustrating, especially when our team couldn't provide definitive answers about room availability.

You're absolutely right about our booking system and staff coordination needing significant improvement. The fact that three different staff members couldn't assist with a simple booking, and that our website isn't functioning properly, is unacceptable. We're currently overhauling our reservation system and providing additional training to ensure our team can handle bookings efficiently.

I'd appreciate the opportunity to discuss this experience with you directly and make arrangements for a proper stay when you're next in Sunyani. Please reach out to me at guestrelations@eusbetthotel.com.

Best regards,
The Eusbett Hotel Management Team

## Example 2: Mixed Rating Review (4 Stars)

### Original Review:
**Guest**: Emmanuel B  
**Rating**: 4/5 stars  
**Platform**: TripAdvisor  
**Review**: "Comfortable stay. However, I will recommend you put a caution statement at the washroom indicating that the first drops of shower within the first 1 minute is very hot so it's advisable to stay away. I nearly got scalded on my first day. That notwithstanding, it was an enjoyable stay."

### OLD RESPONSE (Robotic):
