Totally confused. They asked us to wait till 12pm to see if some occupants will leave the rooms. That was surprising because they couldn\'t even confirm that on their system. We waited and waited as no one was telling us anything. Well, we had to quickly look for another hotel who accepted us well. Obviously Eusbett hotel is overwhelmed by the patronage it receives. Their website is poor as you can\'t even book from there. There will not respond to the emails. My calls were picked but three different attendants could not even do a simple booking for me, only to fly from Accra to Sunyani and you say no room. To think that they even picked us from the airport. They can do better in order to be considered a top hotel.',
