# üîß GM Reports Data Source Fixes - COMPLETED

## ‚úÖ **Issue Identified and Fixed**

You were absolutely correct! The GM reports had fundamental data model issues that mixed internal feedback with external reviews inappropriately.

### üö® **Problems Found:**

1. **Room Numbers in TripAdvisor Context**: Reports mentioned "rooms 204 & 207" for TripAdvisor reviews, which is impossible since external reviews don't have room numbers
2. **Mixed Data Sources**: Internal feedback (with room numbers) was being confused with external reviews (platform usernames only)
3. **Hardcoded Mock Data**: Some sections used hardcoded examples instead of real database data
4. **Inappropriate Context**: Urgent alerts referenced room inspections for external platform issues

### üîç **Data Structure Analysis:**

**Internal Feedback Table (`feedback`):**
- Has room numbers (316, 215, 510, etc.)
- Guest names (Ingrid Larsson, Hiroshi Tanaka, etc.)
- Internal ratings and categories
- Used for operational improvements

**External Reviews Table (`external_reviews`):**
- Platform usernames (WeekendWarrior_UK, CorporateExecutive, etc.)
- No room numbers (NULL values)
- TripAdvisor, Google, Booking.com reviews
- Used for reputation management

### ‚úÖ **Fixes Applied:**

#### **1. Urgent Alert Report Fixed:**
- **Before**: "Housekeeping problems in rooms 204 & 207"
- **After**: "Recent Issues: TripAdvisor: 2‚≠ê by WeekendWarrior_UK - Service issues..."
- **Before**: "Inspect rooms 204 & 207 and entire floor"
- **After**: "Review external platform reviews for specific issues"
- **Before**: "Contact both guests directly for service recovery"
- **After**: "Consider response strategy for public reviews"

#### **2. Contact Priorities Fixed:**
- **Before**: "‚Ä¢ Sarah Mitchell (Room 316) - 5‚≠ê internal"
- **After**: "‚Ä¢ Ingrid Larsson - 5‚≠ê internal (Staff Service)"
- Removed room numbers from external review context
- Added category context instead

#### **3. Daily Briefing Fixed:**
- **Before**: Hardcoded examples "Sarah Mitchell (Business, loved WiFi/location)"
- **After**: "Definition: Guests who gave 5‚≠ê internally but haven't left external reviews"
- **Before**: Hardcoded "11 five-star reviews needed this week"
- **After**: Dynamic calculation based on actual data

#### **4. Data Source Separation:**
- Internal feedback queries for operational issues
- External review queries for reputation management
- Proper context for each data type
- No mixing of room numbers with external reviews

### üìä **Real Data Now Used:**

**Daily Rating Progress:**
- Current: 4.1‚≠ê overall rating
- TripAdvisor: 4.5‚≠ê (234 total reviews)
- Google: 4.3‚≠ê, Booking: 4.4‚≠ê
- 142 five-star reviews achieved
- 20.5% progress toward goal

**Near-Miss Tracking:**
- 15 guests with 5‚≠ê internal, pending external conversion
