# ðŸŽ‰ Thank You Page Acknowledgment Fix - COMPLETE

## ðŸš¨ ISSUE IDENTIFIED & FIXED

### **The Problem:**
The thank you page acknowledgment message (shown when guests don't provide email) had two issues:
1. **Wrong Hotel Name**: Said "Guest Glow Hotel" instead of "Eusbett Hotel"
2. **Too Long**: Generated 250-350 word responses instead of concise acknowledgments

### **Root Cause:**
The `ai-response-generator` edge function had hardcoded "Guest Glow Hotel" in the prompt and was configured for long-form responses.

---

## âœ… WHAT WAS FIXED

### **1. Hotel Name Personalization - FIXED**
- **Before**: Hardcoded "Guest Glow Hotel" in prompt
- **After**: Dynamically fetches tenant name from database
- **Result**: Now says "Eusbett Hotel" correctly

### **2. Response Length - FIXED**
- **Before**: 250-350 words (too long for thank you page)
- **After**: 80-120 words maximum (concise and appropriate)
- **Result**: Brief, meaningful acknowledgments

### **3. Signature Personalization - FIXED**
- **Before**: "The Guest Glow Guest Relations Team"
- **After**: "The Eusbett Hotel Guest Relations Team"
- **Result**: Proper branding throughout

## ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL CHANGES

### **File: `realtime-guest-review/supabase/functions/ai-response-generator/index.ts`**

**Changes Made:**
1. **Added tenant parameter extraction**:
   ```typescript
   const { reviewText, rating, isExternal = false, platform = '', guestName = '', tenant_id = '', tenant_slug = '' } = await req.json();
   ```

2. **Added dynamic tenant name lookup**:
   ```typescript
   let tenantName = 'Eusbett Hotel'; // Default fallback
   if (tenant_id || tenant_slug) {
     // Fetch actual tenant name from database
   }
   ```

3. **Updated prompt to use tenant name**:
   ```typescript
   const prompt = `As a professional ${tenantName} guest relations manager...`
   ```

4. **Shortened response requirements**:
   ```typescript
   - Keep response brief and engaging (80-120 words maximum)
   - Keep response concise but meaningful - 1-2 short paragraphs maximum
   ```

5. **Updated signature**:
   ```typescript
   End with professional signature: "\\n\\nWarm regards,\\nThe ${tenantName} Guest Relations Team"
   ```

### **File: `guestglow-fresh/src/pages/QuickFeedback.tsx`**

**Changes Made:**
1. **Pass tenant information to AI generator**:
   ```typescript
   const { data } = await supabase.functions.invoke('ai-response-generator', {
     body: { 
       reviewText: formData.feedbackText, 
       rating, 
       isExternal: false, 
       guestName: formData.guestName || 'Guest',
       tenant_id: tenant.id,        // âœ… Added
       tenant_slug: tenant.slug     // âœ… Added
     }
   })
   ```
